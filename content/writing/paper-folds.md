Nearly a year ago, I released 
[Unfolded](/art/unfolded) on [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/3177), a generative art project
built around the idea of folding, and then unfolding a sheet of paper. The
heart of this project is a piece of code that computes where all the crests and
valleys appear after applying, and then undoing a series of folds to a
simulated piece of paper.

I want to share how that code works, because the 

I'm thrilled some of the Unfolded outputs are going to be shown at Art Basel,
Miami this year.
