There's a popular misconception these days that generative art requires
randomness. This is totally understandable, as the most popular generative art
projects are "[long-form](https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2021/the-rise-of-long-form-generative-art)",
which do require randomness to provide a high likelihood of uniqueness across
the hundreds (or even thousands) of editions that are generated from a single
program. However, long-form art aside, it is totally possible to create
generative art that requires 0 random numbers during execution.

If I had to create a dichotomy of randomness within generative art, I'd say
that there are broadly 3 categories:

  * No randomness at all.
  * Randomness is only used to generate the input parameters to the generative
    program, but never during its execution.
  * Randomness is used during the generative program's execution.

There's an interesting distinction
