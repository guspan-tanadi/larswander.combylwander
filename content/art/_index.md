When I was little, my dad told me

> "A computer always does _exactly_ what you tell it to do." 

If you've ever been frustrated at your computer, phone, tablet... someone
probably told it to do the wrong thing.

As a fulltime programmer, (or someone who spends most of their time trying to
get computers to do the "right" thing), this bit of advice is very calming --
the computer doesn't have a mind of its own. Odds are, any problem you're
chasing down lies in a mistaken explanation or misunderstanding between you and
the machine.

Yet somehow, and almost as-if by magic, there are times when you know _exactly_ 
what the computer will do, and it still surprises you. I want to capture those
moments in my art.
