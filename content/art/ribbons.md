"Ribbons" are rendered by tracing a 3D curve with a fixed width, applying an
[isometric projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection), and
using occlusion to filter any overlapping sections. The next two pictures give
a sense for how that works:

<div class="grid-2">
  <figure class="wide padded">
    <img src="/img/art/ribbons/high-res/no-occlusion.jpg" alt="All the
    unfiltered lines are shown.">
    <figcaption>
    All lines are drawn, resulting in moire patterns where the ribbons overlap.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure class="wide padded">
    <img src="/img/art/ribbons/high-res/colored-occlusion.jpg" alt="Lines are
    filtered, and colored.">
    <figcaption>
      Overlapping lines are filtered, removing any lines that are obscured by
      higher ribbons.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

It's surprising how much depth is added by dropping a few lines.

Unlike real-life ribbons, these "Ribbons" can intersect and pass through one
another. Many interesting patterns appear when you start trying to draw many
"Ribbons" on top of one another:

<div class="grid-2">
  <figure class="wide padded">
    <img src="/img/art/ribbons/high-res/many-overlap.jpg">
    <figcaption>
      Groups of ribbons forming tangled bands.

  </figure>
  <figure class="wide padded">

    <figcaption>
      Ribbons modulated in decreasing frequencies.

  </figure>
</div>

A few of my favorite outputs were inspired by the idea of making a
"basket-weaving" of ribbons:

<div class="grid-2">

  </figure>
  <figure class="wide padded">
    <img src="/img/art/ribbons/high-res/round-weave.jpg">
  </figure>
</div>
